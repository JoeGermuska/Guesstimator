Setup
========

You'll need a server running PHP 5.3+ and a MySQL db. Pretty much any ol webhost will do.

(Yes, nerd, we know you hate php. We made this on php so that anyone can reuse it with minimal agony.)

Change the following in config > config.ini:

`db_dns=mysql:host=yourhost;port=3306;dbname=

db_name=yourdbame

db_user=yourusername

db_pass=yourpassword`

Copy the files from the db folder into your MySQL database.

Change your questions and totals.

Register a new Twitter app.

Change your client secret xxxx
