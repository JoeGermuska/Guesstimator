*Setup*
You'll need a server running PHP 5.3+ and a MySQL db. Pretty much any ol webhost will do.
(Yes, nerd, we know you hate php. We made this on php so that anyone can reuse it with minimal agony.)

Change the following in config > config.ini:
db_dns=mysql:host=yourhost;port=3306;dbname=
db_name=yourdbame
db_user=yourusername
db_pass=yourpassword
