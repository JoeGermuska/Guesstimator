Guesstimator
=============
Guesstimator is a simple game for testin' your guessin'. [Sisi Wei](http://about.me/sisiwei) and [Rebekah Monson](http://rebekahmonson.com) built it especially to demo at [ONA14](http://ona14.journalists.org/) in glorious ol' Chicago. 

It was built rather quickly, using basic frontend stuff, Tabletop.js and the CensusReporter API, so you can modify it pretty easily for your site and your city/county/state too.

Setup
========





##Built with
[CensusReporter](http://censusreporter.org/)

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Some real janky coding to avoid using any backend at all â€¦

**AND LOOOOOOVE.** &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
