Guesstimator
=============
Guesstimator is a simple game for testin' your guessin'. [Sisi Wei](http://about.me/sisiwei) and [Rebekah Monson](http://rebekahmonson.com) built it especially to demo at [ONA14](http://ona14.journalists.org/) in glorious ol' Chicago. 

It was built rather quickly, using basic frontend stuff, Tabletop.js and the CensusReporter API, so you can modify it pretty easily for your site and your city/county/state too.

Setup
========

1. Head on over to [censusreporter.org](http://censusreporter.org/) and search for your city/state, etc.
2. After the query runs, you will see a number in the URL between the second slash and the first dash. Copy it.
3. Open the script3.js file and change the cityCode variable to the number you copied.
4. Change the city variable to the name of your city/state, etc.
5. Done.
