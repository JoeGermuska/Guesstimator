Guesstimator
=============
Guesstimator is a simple game for testin' your guessin'. [Sisi Wei](http://about.me/sisiwei) and [Rebekah Monson](http://rebekahmonson.com) built it especially to demo at ONA14 in glorious ol' Chicago. 

It was built rather quickly, using basic frontendy stuff, Tabletop.js and the CensusReporter API, so you can modify it pretty easily for your site and your city/county/state too.
