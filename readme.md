Guesstimator
=============
Guesstimator is a simple game for testin' your guessin', and built by [Sisi Wei](http://about.me/sisiwei) and [Rebekah Monson](http://rebekahmonson.com) for ONA14 in glorious ol' Chicago. 

It was built rather quickly, using basic frontendy stuff, Tabletop.js and the CensusReporter API, so you can modify it pretty easily for your city/county/state too.
